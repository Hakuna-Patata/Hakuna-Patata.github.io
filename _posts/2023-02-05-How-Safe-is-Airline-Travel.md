# Introduction
You're sitting on a plane about to take off and then it hits you...FEAR. Like a flash without restraint, you suddenly begin to wonder if the plane is going to make it to its final destination or if some sort of accident will occur. 
<br><br>
This mentality towards airline travel is not an uncommon one and in fact affects a large portion of our population. “_Flying phobia is a highly prevalent anxiety disorder, which causes sufferers significant distress and life interference. The processes which maintain flying phobia remain poorly understood” (Clark & Rock, 2016)_. Ok, so many people are afraid of flying and we don’t know exactly what it comes from, but are these fears valid? Is there a real reason to be afraid of flying? To answer that, let’s dive into some data.

# Overall Numbers

When you see these totals, what are your thoughts? Should these totals be alarming? Should the public be concerned? If you answered, I don't know, then you are correct. <u>In order to get the <b>TRUE</b> story we're going to need to dig a little deeper.</u>


# What Types of Accidents are These?

A large majority of airplane accidents are not related to planes carrying passengers. For example, during WWII many of the airplane accidents were a result of combat. In fact, <b style="color:#3c85fa">64%</b> of ALL fatal accidents are NON-passenger related.

# What is the Trend?

From 1970 to 2020, airline passenger related accidents have declined exponentially. This is due to advancements in both airplane technology and safety regulations. This trend can be seen when viewing the airline passenger fatality rate per 1 million passengers. In 1970, there were 4.6 fatalities per 1 million passengers. In 2020, there were 0.2 fatalities per 1 million passengers which equates to an extremely low mortality rate of 1 fatality per 5 million passengers.

# Airline Passenger vs. Road Travel

Now that we've narrowed our focus on <u>passenger</u> related airline accidents and can see that the accidents are decreasing exponentially over time, it would be nice to compare this type of travel with another form of travel that most people don't think twice about...<u><b>road</b></u> travel! Looking at the graph below, it is quite impressive how much higher the road traffic mortality rate is vs. the airline passenger mortality rate. In fact, when comparing the rates via a line graph, the mortality rate for airline travel appears as a straight line across the bottom of the graph when compared to the road traffic mortality rate.

# Airline Passenger vs. Lightning Strike???
Ok, now that we've compared air travel with road travel, let's compare air travel mortality with lightninig strike mortality. I mean, you HAVE to be more likely to die in an airplane accident vs. getting struck by lightning...right? According to National Geographic, as of 2020 "About 2,000 people are killed worldwide by lightning each year". Comparing that with the airline passenger fatality rate <u>you are actually <b style="color:red">6x more likely</b> to die from a lightning strike</u>.

# Conclusion
Flying is an extremely safe way to travel and it continuously gets safer and safer over time. For me personally, after doing the research for this topic and seeing the data, I feel much more confident about flying and I hope you do too.
